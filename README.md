# react-request-location

This GitHub repository is a practical example that demonstrates how to request and obtain the user's current location in an application. Based on modern geolocation technologies, this project provides a simple and effective solution to retrieve accurate geographical information about the user's current location.

### Key Features
**Permission Request:** The application requests permission from the user to access their current location. This is done through the browser's geolocation APIs, ensuring the user's security and privacy.

**Location Retrieval:** Once permission is granted, the application utilizes the geolocation APIs to retrieve the user's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
