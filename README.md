This is a software project that consists of a frontend developed in React using the Vite library, along with a backend that provides a C# .NET API. The purpose of this project is to allow users to obtain latitude and longitude information, either through IP lookup or by requesting browser location.

## Features
IP Location Lookup: Users have the option to enter an IP address and retrieve location information associated with that IP, including latitude and longitude.

Browser Location: Users can also choose to use the browser's location request. By clicking the corresponding button, the system will prompt the user for permission to access their location information. Upon obtaining permission, the system will retrieve and display the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's current location.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. <br>
Vite: A fast and lightweight build tool for React projects, providing an agile and efficient development environment.
